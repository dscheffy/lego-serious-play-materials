# LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® materials
In 2010, Lego open-sourced the basic parts of their 'Serious Play' methodology. Even 
though it's now 'open', it's quite hard to find the open-sourced parts online. I've 
therefore decided to make them available on GitHub, the home of open-source.

Following is Lego's official anouncement regarding the release:

This document outlines the basic principles of
LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY®. It has been made available
by the LEGO Group under a Creative Commons licence
(‘Attribution Share Alike’: see

for licence details). 

Over the past decade, the LEGO Group has supported the
rigorous and careful development of three types of
LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® resources: 

1. The LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® basic principles
and philosophy, upon which everything else
is built; 
2. The LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® materials – sets
of specially selected LEGO bricks and pieces;
3. LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® ‘applications’ –
detailed roadmaps of different workshops
which make use of the principles and
philosophy, and the materials.

In the past, all three of these were only available
to trained and certificated consultancy professionals.
From June 2010, however, the first two of these have
been made ‘open source’. This document outlines
the basic principles and philosophy; and LEGO® SE-
RIOUS PLAY® boxes (large sets of LEGO bricks and
pieces) are now on sale from the www.seriousplay.
com website.

It does not include detailed applications, because
LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® is entering a new phase.
New applications will be developed by the international
community of users, and may be shared online. In this
new phase, we welcome creative uses of these tools,
and innovation in the community. This document
introduces users to the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY®
approach, so that good use can be made of the
materials. However, in order to make the best use of
these methods it is likely that you would benefit from
the help of a trained LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® facilitator.
